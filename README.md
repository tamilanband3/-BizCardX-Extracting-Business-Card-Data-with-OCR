# -BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR
Bizcard Extraction is a Python application built with Streamlit, EasyOCR, Regex function, and Sqlite3 database. It allows users to extract information from business cards and store it in a Sqlite3 database for further analysis.

What is EasyOCR?
EasyOCR, as the name suggests, is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition.It is a Python library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that allows you to easily extract text from images and scanned documents. In my project I am using easyOCR to extract text from business cards.

When it comes to OCR, EasyOCR is by far the most straightforward way to apply Optical Character Recognition:

*The EasyOCR package can be installed with a single pip command.
*The dependencies on the EasyOCR package are minimal, making it easy to configure your OCR development environment.
*Once EasyOCR is installed, only one import statement is required to import the package into your project.
*From there, all you need is two lines of code to perform OCR â€” one to initialize the Reader class and then another to OCR the image via the readtext function.
